# Web Mill
A free and easy open source website builder meant to be completely self-contained.

**This content management system is still currently in pre-alpha, and should not be used for professional work. Check back at a later date to see when a stable release has come out.**

## Setup:
Simply copy all of these files and folders into the location you want your website to be, and that's all! You will be able to work on the website remotely, and develop it while it's online. Go to https://your-websites-url.com/admin.php and log in. By default, the username and password are always set to "root" for the username, and "root" for the password. To use it locally with PHP's included server **(Make sure you have a current version of PHP installed!)**, instructions are below. Web Mill was built using PHP version 7.3.0, and has not been tested with earlier versions of PHP, like PHP 5. If you need to know your version of PHP, run **php --version** in your preferred shell.

#### Mac/Linux (bash):
Using a shell like Bash, navigate (cd) into the root folder of the project, and type **php -S localhost:8000**. Open your browser go to **localhost:8000**. This will take you to the home (aka index) page. If you want to get to the editor, then navigate to **localhost:8000/admin.php** and login.

#### Windows (command prompt):

In Command Prompt, navigate (cd) into the root folder of the project, and type **php -S localhost:8000**. Open your browser go to **localhost:8000**. This will take you to the home (aka index) page. If you want to get to the editor, then navigate to **localhost:8000/admin.php** and login.
